## Troop 201 Leadership Position Information

Many of you have had questions about when leadership rotations will begin.
Currently there are a few empty positions that will be reviewed for selection
for filling as needed.  The next selection of leadership positions will be
selected for rotations effective at the end of December/beginning of January.
You will be given an opportunity to provide information regarding positions for
which you would like to be considered.

The Troop 201 Executive Committee met this month and new guidelines have been
established for the determining the length and qualification of holding these
positions.  All positions are for 1 year with 2 months of mentorship for their
replacement, however, at 6 months, if a scout has met all of the requirements,
they may set up a review with the Scoutmaster to receive permission to complete
their rotation and make room for the next candidate.  If the scout has met all
of their requirements, then they will immediately move into the role of mentor
for 2 months in order to train their replacement resulting in completion of
their leadership requirement at the 8 month mark.

Each scout will be given a Position of Responsibility (POR) card when they enter
their position.  These cards generally list the requirements of each position.
Each scout must take responsibility to meet the requirements of their position.
Further, if a scout is not meeting their requirements, they will be asked to
meet with the Scoutmaster and may be removed from the position to make room for
a scout who can meet the requirements of the position.

Below is a list of the positions that will be available to meet the Eagle requirements:

: **Senior Patrol Leader**: The senior patrol leader is the top leader of the troop. He is responsible for the troop’s overall operation. With guidance from the Scoutmaster, he takes charge of troop meetings, of the patrol leaders’ council, and of all troop activities, and he does everything he can to help each patrol be successful. He is responsible for annual program planning conferences and assists the Scoutmaster in conducting troop leadership training. The senior patrol leader presides over the patrol leaders’ council and works closely with each patrol leader to plan troop meetings and make arrangements for troop activities. All members of a troop vote by secret ballot to choose their senior patrol leader. Rank and age requirements to be a senior patrol leader are determined by each troop, as is the schedule of elections. During a Scout’s time as senior patrol leader, he is not a member of any patrol but may participate with a Venture patrol in high-adventure activities.

: **Assistant Senior Patrol Leader**:  The assistant senior patrol leader works closely with the senior patrol leader to help the troop move forward and serves as acting senior patrol leader when the senior patrol leader is absent. Among his specific duties, the assistant senior patrol leader trains and provides direction to the troop quartermaster, scribe, historian, librarian, instructors, and Order of the Arrow representative. During his tenure as assistant senior patrol leader he is not a member of a patrol, but he may participate in the high-adventure activities of a Venture patrol. Large troops may have more than one assistant senior patrol leader, each appointed by the senior patrol leader.

: **Patrol Leader**: The patrol leader is the top leader of a patrol. He represents the patrol at all patrol leaders’ council meetings and the annual program planning conference and keeps patrol members informed of decisions made. He plays a key role in planning, leading, and evaluating patrol meetings and activities and prepares the patrol to participate in all troop activities. The patrol leader learns about the abilities of other patrol members and full involves them in patrol and troop activities by assigning them specific tasks and responsibilities. He encourages patrol members to complete advancement requirements and sets a good example by continuing to pursue his own advancement.

: **Troop Guide**: The troop guide is both a leader and a mentor to the members of the new-Scout patrol. He should be an older Scout who holds at least the First Class rank and can work well with younger Scouts. He helps the patrol leader of the new-Scout patrol in much the same way that a Scoutmaster works with a senior patrol leader to provide direction, coaching, and support. The troop guide is not a member of another patrol but may participate in the high-adventure activities of a Venture patrol.

: **Order of the Arrow Troop Representative**: The Order of the Arrow representative serves as a communication link between the troop and the local Order of the Arrow lodge. By enhancing the image of the Order as a service arm to the troop, he promotes the Order, encourages Scouts to take part in all sorts of camping opportunities, and helps pave the way for older Scouts to become involved in high-adventure programs. The OA troop representative assists with leadership skills training. He reports to the assistant senior patrol leader.

: **Den Chief**: The den chief works with a den of Cub Scouts and with their adult leaders. He takes part in den meetings, encourages Cub Scout advancement, and is a role model for younger boys. Serving as den chief can be a great first leadership experience for a Scout.

: **Scribe**: The scribe is the troop’s secretary. Though not a voting member, he attends meetings of the patrol leaders’ council and keeps a record of the discussions. He cooperates with the patrol scribes to record attendance and dues payments at troop meetings and to maintain troop advancement records. A member of the troop committee may assist him with his work.

: **Librarian**: The troop librarian oversees the care and use of troop books, pamphlets, magazines, audiovisuals, and merit badge counselor lists. He checks out these materials to Scouts and leaders and maintains records to ensure that everything is returned. He may also suggest the acquisition of new literature and report the need to repair or replace any current holdings.

: **Historian**: The historian collects and preserves troop photographs, news stories, trophies, flags, scrapbooks, awards, and other memorabilia and makes materials available for Scouting activities, the media, and troop history projects.

: **Quartermaster**: The quartermaster is the troop’s supply boss. He keeps an inventory of troop equipment and sees that the gear is in good condition. He works with patrol quartermasters as they check out equipment and return it, and at meetings of the patrol leaders’ council he reports on the status of equipment in need of replacement or repair. In carrying out his
responsibilities, he may have the guidance of a member of the troop committee.

: **Bugler**: The bugler plays the bugle (or a similar interest) to mark key moments during the day on troop outings, such as reveille and lights out. He must know the required bugle calls and should ideally have earned the Bugling merit badge.

: **Junior Assistant Scoutmaster**: A Scout at least 16 years of age who has shown outstanding leadership skills may be appointed by the senior patrol leader, with the advice and consent of the Scoutmaster, to serve as a junior assistant Scoutmaster. These young men (a troop may have more than one junior assistant Scoutmaster) follow the guidance of the Scoutmaster in providing support and supervision to other boy leaders in the troop. Upon his 18th birthday, a junior assistant Scoutmaster will be eligible to become an assistant Scoutmaster.

: **Chaplain Aide**: The chaplain aide assists the troop chaplain (usually an adult from the troop committee or the chartered organization) in serving the religious needs of the troop. He ensures that religious holidays are considered during the troop’s program planning process and promotes the BSA’s religious emblems program.

: **Instructor**: Each instructor is an older troop member proficient in a Scouting skill. He must also have the ability to teach that skill to others. An instructor typically teaches subjects that Scouts are eager to learn—especially those such as first aid, camping, and backpacking—that are required for outdoor activities and rank advancement. A troop can have more than one instructor.

: **Webmaster**: The troop webmaster is responsible for maintaining the troop’s website. He should make sure that information posted on the website is correct and up to date and that members’ and leaders’ privacy is protected. A member of the troop committee may assist him with his work.

: **Outdoor Ethics Guide**: The outdoor ethics guide helps the troop plan and conduct an outdoor program that emphasizes effectively practicing the principles of outdoor ethics. The guide works to help Scouts improve their outdoor ethics decision-making skills to minimize impacts as they participate in outdoor activities. He supports Scouts who are working to complete the relevant requirements for the Tenderfoot, Second Class and First Class ranks.
