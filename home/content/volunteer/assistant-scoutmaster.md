## Position Description

An assistant Scoutmaster is an adult leader over the age of 18 who helps the
Scoutmaster deliver the promise of Scouting. Each assistant Scoutmaster is
assigned specific program duties. They can serve the troop by guiding a
particular patrol to which they’ve been assigned, advising certain Scouts who’ve
assumed a position e.g. the quartermaster or OA representative, or fill in as
necessary to assure the junior leaders have what they need to run things.
