## Description

The commissioner’s specific mission is to keep units operating at maximum
efficiency so that they can deliver a good program to a growing youth
membership.

Today’s commissioners are results-oriented rather than procedures-oriented. They
are successful in their mission when units continue to operate, units regularly
accept new youth, and units effectively deliver the ideals of Scouting to their
members.

Commissioners are involved with carrying programs to the unit, and their main
concern is to develop strength within the unit operation. Encouraging unit
leaders to attend Roundtables will give the adults resources and ideas for
implementation in their unit.

## Duties

* Supporting unit growth and retention through the journey to excellence.
* Making meaningful unit contacts that capture in commissioner tools their
  strengths, needs, and a unit service plan that enables continuing improvement.
* Linking unit needs to district operating committee and other resources.
* Supporting timely unit, district, and council charter renewals.
* Supporting unit leaders by delivering effective roundtables that provide
  program ideas, relationship development, and timely communication.
* Enable an increased number of traditional units.
* Improve the retention rate of traditional units.
* Enable implementation of a unit service plan through collaborative detailed
  assessments and an increased number of meaningful unit contacts
